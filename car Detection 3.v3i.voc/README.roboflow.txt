The dataset includes 400 images.
Vehicle-fZS6 are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 224x224 (Fit (white edges))
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
